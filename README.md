# Random Workout Generator

A single page site that helps you pick a random workout. Based on a friends suggestion where they used playing cards from a deck to select a random workout move. Built using React as a way to get familiar with it again.

Features:
- Random workout move with a random number of reps from 1 to 14
- Random yoga pose
- Advanced options to chose what workouts, number of different exercises, and number of reps
- Move reminder that goes off hourly to remind you to move
